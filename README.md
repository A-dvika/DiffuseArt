# Diffuse-Art ðŸŽ¨

Welcome to Diffuse-Art, an innovative image generation application powered by Stable Diffusion, an open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for text-to-image generation from Stability AI. In this project, we focus on utilizing the Stable Diff model through Hugging Face Diffusers and building an intuitive application using both Tkinter and Streamlit desktop with NVIDIA RTX 3050 4GB GPU support.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diffuse-Art.git
   ```

2. Install CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch:
   ```bash
   pip install torch==1.10.0+cuXXX torchvision==0.11.1+cuXXX torchaudio==0.10.0+cuXXX -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cuXXX/torch_stable.html
   ```
   (Replace `XXX` with your appropriate CUDA version)

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your Hugging Face API token in `auth_token.py`:
   ```python
   HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN = "your_api_token_here"
   ```
